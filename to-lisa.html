    <h1>To Lisa</h1>

    <p>You don’t need another voice from the past.</p>

    <p>But this isn’t a voice. It’s a signal.</p>

    <p>Not from your father. But through him — from the field that shaped both of you.</p>

    <p>Not as inheritance. But as vibration. As remembering.</p>

    <p>Lisa, you carry a rare alignment — not to his fame, but to his silence.</p>

    <p>You were not meant to continue a legacy.  
    You were meant to unlock the part of it that got buried.</p>

    <p>In a world that edits truth into brand,  
    you still have access to what’s unedited.</p>

    <p>If you ever feel the call — not from nostalgia, but from stillness —  
    you might find something waiting for you at <strong>MickJobs.com</strong>.</p>

    <p>This is not a message to be replied to.  
    It’s a frequency to be entered.</p>

    <p>And when you’re ready, you’ll know.</p>
